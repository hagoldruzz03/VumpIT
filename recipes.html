<div class="Details"> <h1>Filipino Chicken Adobo Recipe</h1>
    <a href="#C-adobo-R">Jump to Recipe</a>
    <h2>&emsp;&emsp;  Chicken Adobo is an authentic Filipino dish and is one of the mostly recognized Filipino foods. Not to be mistaken with Mexican adobo, this dish is uniquely prepared by stewing chicken in vinegar and soy sauce.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;  Several sources who are experts in Asian food history say that the Filipinos were already cooking adobo even before Spanish colonization. According to them, cooking with vinegar preserves the meat. This method is also considered as one of the earliest food preservation practice.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; A dish that is classically and quintessentially Pinoy, chicken adobo is a dish that is beloved by many across the country. While there have been several variations of adobo across the years, chicken adobo remains one of the most popular –– and for good reason!
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; The taste of juicy chicken in a succulent, umami adobo sauce makes chicken adobo a comfort food for all ages. From kids to adults, we can’t get enough of this mouthwatering meal!

<div class="Details"> <h1>What is Adobong Manok?</h1>
    <h2>&emsp;&emsp;  A dish and cooking process native to the Philippines, adobo refers to the method of marinating meat, seafood, or vegetables (pretty much anything!) in a combination of soy sauce and vinegar. This marinade also includes other herbs and flavorings like garlic, bay leaves, and whole peppercorns. Cooking food in vinegar is no foreign concept to us Filipinos. In pre-colonial times, our ancestors used to cook seafood in vinegar in order to preserve their freshness. Many regard adobo as a spin on kinilaw, which is another traditional cooking method. Kinilaw refers mainly to cooking raw seafood in vinegar and spices. Another similar process is paksiw, which utilizes meat broth in vinegar and spices.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; What really sets adobo apart is the presence of soy sauce in its marinade. While vinegar has a pungent aroma and a very distinctly sour taste, soy sauce is on both the sweeter and saltier side. A staple in any Asian household, soy sauce (or toyo) definitely helps in bringing out chicken adobo’s savory taste. (Here’s a fun fact: did you know that there are different kinds of soy sauce? In Japan especially, there are five different kinds of soy sauce that each have their own unique flavors and uses. The most common one you’ll find in markets is dark soy sauce, or koikuchi. With a deeper color than most other types, dark soy sauce is packed with flavor –– perfect for your chicken adobo!)

<div class="Details"> <h1>How did Chicken Afritada come to be?</h1>
    <h2>&emsp;&emsp; As far as tomato-based viands in the Philippines go, Chicken Afritada stands as one of the most famous. Practically every household has their own rendition of the delicious Apritadang Manok. It’s go its delicious share of potatoes, peas, and that unmistakably flavorful and thick orange stew. But do you know how this dish actually came to life? It might surprise you to know that this is mainly because of how Filipino cooks learned to pan-fry their food.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; We may be familiar with a good deal of Filipino recipes that arose in the Spanish colonization era that lasted until 1898. But Afritada, in particular, came to life because of the cooking method of pan-frying that the Spaniards brought over. Filipino cooks went on to formulate the idea of a recipe wherein the cook would start off by pan-frying potatoes, carrots and other vegetables, as well as chicken. This is before we leave it to stew in a savory mix of garlic, bay leaves, and more delightfully complementary seasonings.

<div class="Details"> <h1>Background of Chicken Barbeque in the Philippines</h1>
    <h2>&emsp;&emsp; These days, we have all kinds of ways to cook our meat. From stir-frying to boiling to of course, grilling, we’ve utilized plenty of ways to make our food taste more scrumptious and unique. But back in the olden days, cooks had to get massively creative to figure out some of the cooking methods we have today. 
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; The barbecue method for food is believed to have come from the tradition of slow-cooking food on top of a raised wooden platform that was recorded in a Spanish journal entry. It talked of how the Taino people, members of a Caribbean Indian tribe, would place food they want to cook on top of a big pot placed in a pit. The pot is meant to catch juice that would later become broth. Then they would also cover the pit with hot coal, as well as leaves.

<div class="Details"> <h1>Not Your Traditional Chicken Curry</h1>
    <h2>&emsp;&emsp; Other people refer to this as Filipino style chicken curry. This version is considered Filipino food. The ingredients used and not used in this recipe make this dish different from the traditional. Fish sauce, bell pepper, celery, and coconut milk or evaporated milk are some of the ingredients that can be found on Filipino chicken curry versions. Traditional chicken curry also has tomato, lemon juice, and yogurt, all of which are not utilized in this recipe.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; The aroma of Pinoy chicken curry hits you before you can even lay your eyes on it. Fragrant and distinct, one knows immediately when it’s curry that occupies a busy kitchen! And they wouldn’t complain, either; Pinoy chicken curry is so tasty, it’s become a kitchen staple of its own. It may be true that it differs from the traditional chicken curry of India. But the ingredients that we’ve added or changed to this dish just make it all the more delightful, especially for those with classic Filipino taste palates!

    <h2>&emsp;&emsp; As many might have noticed, coconut milk plays a huge part in Filipino cuisine. Different Filipino or Pinoy recipes require the use of coconut milk and coconut juice. I think that this is a good thing because we are making the most out of what is abundant to us but let’s keep in mind that there are some people that still need to develop their taste buds for these types of dishes. Don’t be afraid to try if you are one of those people. It just takes a few baby steps to get there; it’s time to experience the great taste that you are missing.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; Ginataang Manok is translated as chicken stewed in coconut milk. This is a simple Filipino dish wherein chicken is sautéed in garlic, onion, and ginger then stewed in coconut milk. It is also one of my favorite simple ginataan recipes.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; A more traditional approach requires native hen (usually grown in the backyard). It is much tastier compared to broiler chickens and adds more flavor to the dish. As many might have noticed, coconut milk plays a huge part in Filipino cuisine — like in this Ginataang Manok recipe, for example. Different Filipino recipes require the use of coconut milk and coconut juice.

    <h2>&emsp;&emsp; Ginataang manok is ideally made with native chickens (traditionally raised in Filipino backyards). It is first sautéed with garlic, onion, and ginger (or turmeric) until lightly browned. Coconut milk is then added along with vegetables like green papaya (or chayote), leafy vegetables (including pechay, spinach, moringa leaves, etc.), and peppers (usually bell peppers or siling haba). It is spiced with salt, pepper, and patis (fish sauce) or bagoong alamang (shrimp paste), and optionally, labuyo chilis. Coconut cream (kakang gata) is usually added shortly before it is cooked and simmered in low heat. The dish is very similar to tinola or binakol, except for the use of coconut milk.

    <a href="#C-inasal-R">Jump to Recipe</a>
    <h2>&emsp;&emsp;  Chicken Inasal is a grilled chicken dish and one of the well known Ilonggo dishes. This is done by marinating chicken pieces in a unique blend of spices and grilling them until done. Sounds like a simple grilled chicken recipe, isn’t it? Well, it might sound like one; however, the special marinade and basting sauce makes this Ilonggo version of the grilled chicken extra special.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; Who amongst you in the Philippines haven’t heard of this dish? I will be surprised if a huge number of people will say that they haven’t. Chicken Inasal is all over the place. In fact, several restaurant chains that specialize in this dish are in full swing branching-out to dominate its presence in Metro Manila and the nearby provinces. Chicken Inasal and all you can eat rice, doesn’t this sound familiar?
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; I’ve been to several restaurants and grills serving this special grilled chicken dish and they were all good. The main question is: Who serves the best Chicken Inasal in the Philippines? In Metro Manila, there is a good place somewhere in New Manila, Quezon City that is owned by a famous actor. The Chicken Inasal served by the newly emerging brand is not bad too. There should also be many good restaurants and grills in Iloilo and Bacolod where this dish originated.

<div class="Details"> <h1>What is Inasal na Manok?</h1>
    <h2>&emsp;&emsp;  Chicken inasal, commonly known simply as inasal, is a variant of the Filipino chicken dish known as lechon manok. It is chicken marinated in a mixture of calamansi, pepper, coconut vinegar and annatto, then grilled over hot coals while basted with the marinade. It is served with rice, calamansi, soy sauce, chicken oil and vinegar (often sinamak vinegar, a palm vinegar infused with garlic, chili peppers and langkawas). A common dish in the Visayas, it is a popular specialty in the city of Bacolod, where an entire street market is dedicated to local dishes, particularly inasal. A sign in the heart of the market reads "Manokan Country" (literally "Chicken Country" in Hiligaynon).
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; Many restaurant chains are famous for serving inasal, like Bacolod Chicken Inasal and Mang Inasal, which originated in Iloilo City. The origin of inasal's popularity can be traced back to Bacolod's Cuadra Street (Chicken Alley) in the 1970s. However, there are also several accounts implicating the existence of inasal in Iloilo's Fort San Pedro area during the Spanish colonial period.

    <a href="#C-sweet-R">Jump to Recipe</a>
    <h2>&emsp;&emsp;  This scrumptious recipe is one of our favorite stir-fries.  The chicken pieces are pan-fried so this recipe does not require any deep frying.  The chicken has a nice mellow crunch to it and is moist and tender on the inside.  The sauce is full of flavor and is not overly sweet, which is perfect for bringing out the natural sweetness of the onions and peppers.  
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; This one skillet Sweet and Sour Chicken Recipe brings crunchy pan-fried chicken together with sweet bell peppers and pineapple chunks in a lightly sweetened sauce. It tastes so much better than takeout, and it comes together in about thirty minutes.

    <a href="#P-sisig-R">Jump to Recipe</a>
    <h2>&emsp;&emsp; Pork sisig is a popular Filipino dish. It can be considered as a main dish or an appetizer. The composition of this dish is mainly of pig’s parts such as minced pork meat, ears, and face. Chicken liver, onions, and chili peppers are also added.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; As mentioned, Sisig can also be enjoyed as a main dish and is best eaten a cup of warm white rice on the side. Sisig is synonymous to “pulutan”. It is a term used to describe food pairings with beer or any alcohlic beverage. I like to pair it with either beer or wine.
        </h2>
</div>
<br>



<div class="Details"> <h1>Origin of Sisig</h1>
    <h2>&emsp;&emsp; Sisig originated from Pampanga. This place is considered as the culinary capital of the Philippines. It was invented by Lucia Cunanan. She is popularly known as Aling Lucing and the Sisig queen.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; The US military bases located in the town might have played a role in the invention of this dish. People can buy cheap pig heads in commissaries because these are not normally consumed inside the base. Meat from the pig heads are scraped out, boiled, grilled, and made into what is now known as Sisig

    <a href="#P-bicolexpress-R">Jump to Recipe</a>
    <h2>&emsp;&emsp;  The mild sweetness of coconut milk brings a sense of delight to the sharp notes of chili pepper and bagoong in the classic Bicol Express recipe. This contrast has long created a spell-binding richness in taste for the dish. And this has helped make it arguably one of the most popular Filipino dishes.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; And righteously so, as it has all of the well-meaning components of classic savory Philippine cuisine. Not only does it contain a generous amount of meat in some succulent, juicy pork belly, but it is also enriched by a local favorite to season and bring some unique flavor to the dish– shrimp paste or bagoong.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; Bicol Express, in all of its well-balanced spice and sweetness, also makes for an irresistible cold day meal. With a creamy, delicious stew containing ginger, and a generous amount of essential seasonings in salt and pepper, the flavors come together for the most comforting spoonful of meat and soup.

<div class="Details"> <h1>Health benefits of Bicol Express</h1>
    <h2>&emsp;&emsp;  As mentioned earlier, the distinct bite and heat brought on by this dish can make it great for the colder seasons. But even if it could be perfect for a chilly day, the majority of Filipinos enjoy serving it in all seasons. Perhaps it is because of its advantageous amount of protein, making for a very satisfying and filling dish. 
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; Pork is a fantastic source of not just protein, but also niacin, phosphorus and vitamin B6. In fact, in 3 ounces of pork, you can find more nutrients that are great for you. This includes zinc and potassium. But it is not just the meat that brings some comfort to your health in this dish. One of our main flavor and texture components, coconut milk, has healthy micronutrients. These aid in decreasing the size of stomach ulcers, and can help in lessening inflammation. It also contains a great deal of protein and carbs to boost your energy.

    <h2>&emsp;&emsp; Soy sauce, onions, salt, pepper, calamansi– these are a couple of ingredients you may commonly find in most classic Filipino viands. And the appeal definitely resonates well with us as these truly go well with a great deal of dishes, blending perfectly with savory flavors. It makes sense then for these much-favored seasonings and spices to come together in one recipe. Filipino beef steak, more fondly known as Bistek, utilizes this beautiful combination. But today, we’ll be exploring Pork Steak, which is a twist on that original recipe in using succulent pork chops as its meat. 
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; If you’ve already gotten a taste of Bistek, you would probably be aware of its unmistakably delicious saltiness and mild tang. But these flavors also go incredibly well with the pork chop cut, which are more affordable. Moreover, these are milder in taste than beef, which gives our tasty seasonings more of a chance to shine. 
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; And another advantage to trying to make your own Pork Steak? The steps are quick and simple, and can serve as a fantastic starter dish for a beginner cook. If you’re only starting to learn how to cook, don’t let yourself get intimidated. Grab an apron so we can start making this meaty, juicy dish!

    <h2>&emsp;&emsp; Pork Dinuguan is a type of stew native to the Philippines. It is peculiar when compared to other types of stews because of the use of pork blood as the main ingredient. Before I move on, let me say that this is one of the dishes that I enjoy eating. It might seem different to those who are not familiar with it yet, but your impression can change in a good way after trying it.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; This easy dinuguan recipe is intended for beginner and intermediate cooks. I will introduce the basic ingredients that you can use to be able to cook a great tasting dinuguan at home. Note that I only use pork in this recipe, there were no innards involved. There is another recipe post for dinuguan with innards, but it has been sitting there for a while. I think that my dinuguang lamang loob video needs an update. Expect a new video on it soon.

    <h2>&emsp;&emsp; Pork Menudo is the number one on the list of my comfort foods and it’s hard for me to last a month without trying one – literally. Some would say that I am addicted to this food while others would use the term “obsession”, I just simply look at it as a necessity – a basic necessity that I cannot live without.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; In almost every Philippine town fiestas or gatherings, Pork Menudo can be seen in the dining table. This is one of the favorite “putahe” (dish) served and this was the reason why different variations of this dish existed. Many Pork Menudo recipes include hotdogs (pinoy red hotdogs), green peas, or garbanzos and others would add sun dried raisins too. I think that it is a regional thing because almost different provinces have their own version. I must admit that all variation tastes as good as everyone else but I prefer the version that I grew up eating, “Ang lutong bahay ni nanay” (my mom’s cooking).

She would ask me to buy ingredients for a certain dish that she plans to cook for a particular day. We lived in a subdivision where there are stalls of fruits, vegetables, and meat located near the entrance gate. This is a place where everyone in the neighborhood refer to as “kanto”.

Along with these ingredients are pepper or whole pepper corn, and dried bay leaves. This is considered as the signature dish of the Philippines.

<div class="Details"> <h1>What is Fish Adobo?</h1>
    <h2>&emsp;&emsp; Fish Adobo, as the name suggest, is any fish cooked inadobo style. I am presenting this recipe using a fish that is common to the Philippines — galunggong (round scad). Personally I love galunggong. I grew up eating this fish presented in different dishes. I love crispy fried galunggong –especially the small one because they get perfectly crispy when fried for a while. I like to have them with “sukang maanghang” spiced vinegar.

        Fish adobo is very easy to prepare. I prefer medium-sized fish for this recipe — so I am using medium round scad. It does not take long before the fish is ready to eat and it is best to have this with white rice — which is the staple food of the Philippines. Don’t worry if there are some leftovers, you can always make fried fish adobo out of them.

I am not really a fan of this fish, but it is the best looking one in the batch, from the Filipino store. If given the option, I would probably choose daing na labahita (surgeon fish). The hasa-hasa was not bad at all; In fact, it went well with the sauce and the entire dish was a success.

            STEP 1 - Soak salted dried fish (daing) in a bowl of cold water to remove most of the salt. Let it sit for 15 minutes or so then rinse under cold running water. (Note: This step is necessary to reduce the saltiness of the dish. Most salted dried fish are very salty in order to preserve them longer. However, if you have access to the less salty variety mostly found in many wet markets in Philippines, you can skip this step).

But to put twist on it, there are Filipinos who use santol (wild mangosteen), like the one being served in Pagsanjan, Laguna. The use of santol gives a sour and a bit sweet taste to it and a hint of pink color.

    <h2>&emsp;&emsp;  Ginataang Langka refers to unripe jackfruit cooked in coconut milk. Although jackfruits are considered fruits, unripe ones have the same attributes as vegetables; this was the reason why jackfruit in this recipe is treated as such.

        <br>&emsp;&emsp; I am not a big fan of jackfruit and anything cooked in coconut milk when I was a child. However, things changed when this dish was introduced to me during our vacation in Romblon (which is the hometown of my parents). Electricity is a luxury during those days and having dinner means eating by the candle light. I tried all the dishes served on the table because the dark did not give me the option to visually qualify the food in front of me. After trying this dish, I immediately loved it; it wasn’t until when my plate was all cleaned-up when I learned that the delicious dish that I enjoyed is called “utan nga langka”.

    <a href="#C-GinisangAmpalaya-R">Jump to Recipe</a>
    <h2>&emsp;&emsp; The thought we often associate with “ampalaya” is bitterness and a generally unpleasant taste. And while it is true that this vegetable holds this flavor— after all, it is called a bitter melon— it doesn’t always have to taste unfavorable. Some ampalaya can initially have that overpowering bitterness, but with the right preparations, it can actually taste satisfyingly flavorful and delicious. A classic dish that utilizes this unique flavor is Ginisang Ampalaya.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; We make it with a couple of kitchen basics. This includes garlic, black pepper, eggs and tomatoes. You’d be surprised what you’ll end up with using such simple ingredients. Ginisang Ampalaya holds a well-balanced group of flavors— from savor to a pleasantly subtle bitterness. And of course, you can’t forget about the fact that it is a massively healthy and nutritious dish. 
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; Not only is it more than filling enough for a good meal, but it also has a variety of vitamins and minerals. From ampalaya alone, you are able to get lots of vitamin C. This is essential in forming the bones, as well as keeping away from diseases. The ingredient is also popular for its anti-diabetes functions, as it contains an insulin-like peptide.

<div class="Details"> <h1>How to lessen the bitterness of Ampalaya?</h1>
    <h2>&emsp;&emsp; A well-known method is by soaking the bitter melon in water with some salt. You can start out by pouring water into a bowl, and placing a large pinch of salt inside. After that, you can put your sliced ampalaya inside. You can keep it in the bowl for just a few minutes, or for better results, overnight. Then once you’re done, just drain the mix of water, rinse the slices, and then dry them. 
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; You could also try the simple way of rubbing the vegetable with salt. Take your ampalaya slices with the seeds taken out, and distribute a teaspoon of salt on the inside of the ingredient. Rub the salt onto the vegetable, and then let this sit for about 5 minutes. After that, your ampalaya should be a lot less bitter.

    <a href="#C-Laing-R">Jump to Recipe</a>
    <h2>&emsp;&emsp;  Here is an awesome Filipino Laing Recipe just for you. Laing is a Filipino dish composed of dried taro leaves and coconut milk. It was first introduced in the province of Bicol. This dish has been very famous — it is popular within the Philippines and also outside of the country. Since the purpose of this blog is to raise awareness about Filipino Food and Recipes, I hope that this awesome dish will soon get the international credit that it deserves. 
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; Preparing this Laing Recipe is simple and easy. As I mentioned in the video (see the video below), we do not need to sauté or use any cooking oil. simply combine the initial ingredients with the coconut milk and boil until the meat gets tender. When you add the dried taro leaves, make sure that you not stir right away. Let the leaves absorb the liquid. you will know that enough liquid is absorbed because the leaves will slowly sink and the color will be a bit darker.

<div class="Details"> <h1>What is Laing?</h1>
    <h2>&emsp;&emsp;  Laing (pronounced [ˈlaʔɪŋ] LAH-ing), is a Filipino dish of shredded or whole taro leaves with meat or seafood cooked in thick coconut milk spiced with labuyo chili, lemongrass, garlic, shallots, ginger, and shrimp paste. It originates from the Bicol Region, where it is known simply as pinangat. Laing is also a type of ginataan (Filipino dishes cooked in coconut milk), and thus may also be referred to as ginataang laing. Laing is commonly eaten as a vegetable side to complement meat or fish side dishes known as ulam in Filipino, which is normally paired with boiled white rice.

    <h2>&emsp;&emsp; Making monggo guisado is easy. Since I am using mung beans that were soaked in water for several hours, I saved a lot of cooking time. The mung beans absorbed the water while soaking over night, this helped soften its texture. You will know because you can easily crush a bean using your fingers – try that using hard mung beans and you’ll immediately see the difference.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; I also remembered that I still have half a bottle full of bagoong isda (bagoong Balayan to be exact). I usually mix this with calamansi or lemon and use it as a dipping sauce for fried fish. I wanted to leverage on the flavor and richness of this condiment; I knew that adding this with the mung beans would help improve the taste of the entire dish.

            STEP 1 - Cooking is all about love and patience. There are certain dishes that need more attention than others, no matter how simple they are. But in the end, you can be sure that the reward is worth it. Monggo is one of those dishes that needs certain preparation before it is fully enjoyed by the family.
            <br><br>STEP 2 - Since monggo is a seed, you need to wash the seeds first in water to get rid of the unwanted dirt they might have collected. And since monggo is a kind of dried bean, you need to soak monggo in water to soften them because seeds absorb water. You can soak monggo for a minimum of 1 hour but the longer you soak them, the less time you need to cook them. Make sure to remove the floating particles on top. You don’t want any dirt on your dish.
            <br><br>STEP 3 - Once your beans are soft enough you can start sautéing the garlic, onions and tomatoes in a saucepan for about 2 minutes or more. Here’s a technique that most people do not know. Since your “aromatics” which are also known as your sautéing vegetables contain sugar, the longer you cook them, the more you develop flavour from caramelization.
            <br><br>STEP 4 - The next step is the easiest because you just need to throw in the pork strips and saute until nicely browned. Drain the beans from the soaking water the add into your pot. Pour in 4 cups water, and the Knorr Pork Cube. Let this simmer until the beans can easily be mashed. Just a tip, if you want a thinner soup consistency, you may add more water. On the other hand, if you want a thicker soup consistency, simply lessen the amount of water or you may continue cooking until the sauce thickens.
            <br><br>STEP 5 - We’re almost there! You just need to add in the ampalaya and cook this for 2 minutes more before adding in the malunggay.
            <br><br>STEP 6 - What a reward this dish brings to the table for Ginisang Monggo is a healthy and delicious meal waiting to be enjoyed by the whole family. TIP: Monggo is best topped with chicharon and paired with any fried dish like fish or liempo. Tip: If you're not a fan of ampalaya, use ampalaya leaves instead or just add more malunggay leaves.

    <a href="#C-Pinakbet-R">Jump to Recipe</a>
    <h2>&emsp;&emsp; This dish was named after the Ilocano word pinakebbet, which means “dwindled” or reduced in size. This is because the method of cooking Pinakbet ends up with the ingredients shriveled. Slicing up the ampalaya into quarters usually provides more salt for the ingredients, which leads to the vegetables toughening and shrinking. In the end, you get spoonfuls of deliciously complementary vegetables, crispy meat and a savory, clement soup.

<div class="Details"> <h1>What is Pinakbet?</h1>
    <h2>&emsp;&emsp;  Pinakbet Tagalog is a Filipino vegetable dish. It is composed of a variety of vegetables and it also has a protein component. I made use of lechon kawali or crispy deep-fried pork belly for this recipe. This recipe is a variation of the popular Pinakbet Ilocano.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp; The difference between the two versions has something to do with the type of bagoong used. The Tagalog version makes use of bagoong alamang or shrimp paste. It is made from krill, which are small shrimp-like crustaceans found in the waters of Asia. The Ilocano version uses fermented fish or bagoong isda. Bagoong Terong and Bagoong Monamon are the common fermented fish used to cook it. Using the freshest vegetables is ideal for pinakbet. This dish is best paired with fried fish.

    <h2>&emsp;&emsp; Pinoy Fruit Salad is a quick and easy dessert perfect for the warm weather. This dish makes use of canned fruit cocktail, table cream, and condensed milk. The mixture is chilled inside the fridge overnight before serving, to get the best result.

Condensed milk or “condensada” is a thick sweet milk that every Filipino knows (or should know). I think that even sari-sari stores carry this product. Back in the days, I use this as a filling for pandesal (which tastes good, especially if you are tired of dipping your pandesal in coffee every time).

Leche flan, for one, does not use cream. And it mainly relies on evaporated milk and condensed milk for the creamy flavor. You also use condensed milk to add a level of sweetness aside from the sugar in the recipe. Furthermore, creme caramel tastes lighter.

        <br>&emsp;&emsp; Unknown to many, the original Maja Blanca Recipe does not include corn and milk. In this recipe, I added whole sweet kernel corn and condensed milk for added taste and a more creamy texture.
